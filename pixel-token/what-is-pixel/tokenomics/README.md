In terms of tokenomics, the distribution of Pixel token is designed to promote widespread adoption and participation in the ecosystem. A predetermined supply of Pixel tokens will be generated, with a portion allocated for the initial token sale to fund development and further adoption efforts. The remaining tokens will be distributed through various mechanisms, including community rewards, partnerships, and ecosystem development initiatives. This approach ensures a fair and inclusive distribution of Pixel tokens, encouraging active participation and engagement within the VeChain community.
